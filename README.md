## Folders

- `diagrams/` – Network diagrams and architecture overviews  
- `windows-lab/` – Setup steps, hardening notes, PowerShell commands  
- `linux-lab/` – Setup, users, permissions, services  
- `wireshark/` – Packet capture notes, screenshots, and analyses

This is a work in progress as I build out my skills.
